      <h2>Miwa Natsuki</h2>
      <h3>Co-founder | MA Kinesiology</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Miwa Natsuki</strong>, MA, began her career in the fitness industry in 2005 at UC Berkeley, when she was trained to 
        become a Group Exercise instructor while pursuing her undergraduate degree. Since then, she has completed her graduate degree 
        in Kinesiology, with a focus on education and behavior change, at Saint Maryâ€™s College.
      </p>
      <p>
        UrbanPlay was created based on her research during her graduate studies, her experience working with kids through various 
        organizations and also many years of her experience working as personal trainer and health coach with the adult population. 
        Furthermore, her passion to create UrbanPlay was fueled by her own transformation from being an overweight and sedentary kid.
